# **Start Up:**
1) Run ServerMain (this is the ChatServer).
2) Run StartingGUI to startup threads of clients to connect to the chatServer.

This version is currently for offline connections.

# _**TODO**_:
 - Online connections be comin.
 - new ServerSocket(_8080, 50, InetAddress.getByName("0.0.0.0")_); - port, backlog (50 being connections that can wait when all possible connection slots are full).
 - dabble with Security i.e: SSL TLS, Authentication, better logs - monitoring.
 - DNS.
